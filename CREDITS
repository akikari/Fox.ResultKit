First Release: 2026-02-07 (v1.0.0)


Project Vision and Design Philosophy
-------------------------------------
Fox.ResultKit was created to provide a lightweight, type-safe alternative for
result handling in .NET applications without the complexity and dependencies
of larger frameworks.

The project embodies several key principles:

1. Zero Dependencies Philosophy
   The core Fox.ResultKit library has no external dependencies, ensuring minimal
   footprint and maximum compatibility across .NET 8, 9, and 10.

2. Railway Oriented Programming
   Inspired by Scott Wlaschin's Railway Oriented Programming pattern and F#'s
   Result type, the library brings functional composition to C# through a fluent
   API with Map, Bind, Ensure, Tap, and Match extensions.

3. Explicit Over Implicit
   Method signatures clearly reveal possible failures through Result<T> return
   types, replacing hidden exceptions and nullable references with explicit
   success/failure modeling.

4. Async-First Design
   All functional extensions have async variants (MapAsync, BindAsync, etc.),
   recognizing that modern .NET applications are inherently asynchronous.

5. Developer Experience
   Complete XML documentation, IntelliSense support, and nullable reference
   type annotations ensure a smooth development experience.


Architectural Highlights
-------------------------
- Result<T> and Result: Core types for success/failure modeling
- ErrorsResult: Aggregates multiple validation errors for better user experience
- IResult: Common interface enabling polymorphic operations on mixed Result types
- Fluent API: Chainable extensions for functional composition
- MediatR Integration: Seamless CQRS pattern support via Fox.ResultKit.MediatR


Design Decisions
-----------------
The project was deliberately designed to:

- Avoid the complexity of large functional programming frameworks (e.g., LanguageExt)
- Provide a simpler, lighter alternative to FluentResults for domain logic
- Support modern .NET features (nullable references, records, pattern matching)
- Enable both fail-fast validation chains (Bind) and error collection (ErrorsResult)
- Maintain backward compatibility across .NET Long-Term Support versions


Inspirations and Influences
----------------------------
This project draws inspiration from:

- F# Result type and Option type
- Scott Wlaschin's Railway Oriented Programming concepts
- Functional programming principles applied to C# idioms
- The broader .NET community's exploration of functional patterns


Acknowledgments
---------------
Special thanks to the .NET community for fostering discussions around functional
programming patterns, error handling best practices, and the continuous evolution
of C# as a multi-paradigm language.
